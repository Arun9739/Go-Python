# Daily Programming Practice :

Daily python programming is one which makes our basic concepts strong. So let's have a quick tour around it.

- [Hello World program](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/Hello%20World.py) : This is beginner problem which prints Hello World to the output.

- [Sum of two numbers](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/SumOfTwoNumbers.py) : This is basic arithmetic program which adds two numbers and prints their result.

- [Full name](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/FullName.py) : This is string concatenation program which prints full name by taking two strings.

- [Find Largest](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/FindLargest.py) : This program finds largest number between given two numbers.

- [Remainder of two numbers](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/RemainderOfTwoNums.py) : This program prints remainder of two numbers.

- [Print Numbers](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/PrintNumbers.py) : This program prints given 'N' number of elements.

- [Find Smallest](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/FindSmallest.py) : This program prints smallest number of two given number.

- [Make Upper](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/MakeUpper.py) : This program converts all the characters of given string to upper case.

- [Voter Elgibility](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/VoterEligibility.py) : This program takes age as input and says whether he is eligible for vote or not.

- [Calculate speed](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/calculate_speed.py) : This program calculates speed of a vehicle by taking distance and time as input.

- [Read numbers](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/ReadNumbers.py) : This program takes 'N' numbers from user and prints them.

- [Print Rev Numbers](https://github.com/Arun9739/Go-Python/blob/main/Daily_programming_practice/PrintRevNumbers.py) : This program prints the numbers in reverse order starting from the given 'n' number.
